        been disturbed by him….Fine, “don’t care what will happen in the future, but only care what is happening now”. Though I always use this sentence to persuade myself, is it really working on me?…“He will come back one day”….I am lying to myself….
        　　I am really scared. Scared about the day he’s leaving, I don’t know how I could act, don’t know what I could say to him, either….I never had such strong feeling that want the time to stop, just sitting on the couch alongside of him quietly,
        putting my head on his shoulder, and his hand holding mine……. 　　Always secretly looking at him more, because I know I will have no chance to see him like this very soon, because I know clearly from my heart that once he leaves, that is leaving
        forever. 　　God is playing game with me; God is taking advantage of me! Why after you let me fell for him then lead the way to the one that I never can have a result with him?! It could be better if you not let us even met each other at the first
        place!!! Even if there’s no one loves me; even if I don’t fell for anyone, which is even better than the situation now that we will be part away from each other. 　　Eric, I’m afraid I will really really miss you, I’m afraid you will forget me after
        you go back to America….but the most scared thing for me is couldn’t have your last name, couldn’t be together with you in my life….Clearly, I have swore that never been touched easily again by a man, but why finally I still could not control
